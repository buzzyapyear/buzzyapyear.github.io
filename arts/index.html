        <h3>Dancing with Teacher Gudrun</h3>

        <p>On Tuesdays we have an optional yoga/dance class filled with fun and creative activities. The yoga segment encourages self­ expression, body and breath awareness, and positive thinking in a non-competitive environment. The kids will work on building motor coordination, strength, flexibility, concentration, and calmness, but most importantly have fun together with imaginary play, craft, dance and storytelling! (Mats provided.) The creative dance segment includes a specific dance concept (self space/general space, speed, directions etc.), developmental movement patterns called [BrainDance](http://creativedance.org/about/braindance), movement exploration though improvisation, an obstacle course, and a lot of dancing together.</p>

        <p>Gudrun is a contemporary dancer and choreographer, a licensed Next Generation Yoga teacher for kids, certificated prenatal/postnatal yoga teacher, infant massage teacher, and has completed Anne Green Gilbert’s foundational course in Brain-Compatible Dance Teaching Methods. Movement has been Gudrun’s passion in life, she has been dancing for as long as she can remember. When Gudrun became a parent and learned more about child development, she was blown away by how big a role movement plays in brain development, and how dance and yoga can support physical, intellectual, emotional and creative development.</p>

        <h3>Singing with Teacher Andrew</h3>

        <p>Teacher Andrew brings his guitar &amp; a bevy of instruments (egg shakers, a parachute, scarves, and more!) to share with kids & adults alike each Friday, as he leads the parents in a number of musical activities, including raucous sing-a-longs, easy call-and-response patterns, and tonal games. Children are free to dance, move, sit quietly, or do whatever the music makes them feel (so long as it is safe and not disruptive to other children!), as the adults participate & teach through modeling musical behaviors.</p>

        <p>The program is rooted in the knowledge that children are inherently musical, they learn by watching &amp; imitating, and there are few things as satisfying as making music with friends &amp; family, regardless of one's skill level.</p>
