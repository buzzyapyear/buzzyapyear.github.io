<p><strong>My name is Chris Yap.</strong></p>

<p>I've been developing and designing websites since my college days,
a quaint time when blinking text was a surprisingly common design element. I was a politics major in college, but
the "new media" technology of websites always fascinated me. I began
learning all I could about developing and designing websites and never looked back.</p>

<p>I currently work as a software developer for a young company called <a href="http://www.flowgram.com">Flowgram</a> that I am very excited about... check out this <a href="http://www.flowgram.com/fg/8HBDOR5O2QVZQO/">silly Flowgram</a> I made as a demo. I also co-founded and run a web services agency, <a href="http://www.exobi.com">Exobi Interactive</a>.</p>

<p>I've been an avid electronic music DJ for the past 13 years and spent many years as an event promoter. In these pursuits I value
originality and creativity, and I tend to deviate from mainstream musical tastes.  I've been "retired" for a few years now but would be happy to play out again for a fun event, drop me a line if you're interested.</p>

<p>Feel free to contact me via my contact form. Thanks for looking.</p>
