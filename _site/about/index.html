            Noe Valley Nursery School (NVNS) is a co-operative preschool founded by a group of neighborhood parents in 1969. The school believes in a play-based, child-centered, and developmentally-appropriate philosophy of preschool education.

Noe Valley Nursery School is a community of parents interested in taking part in their children's preschool experience. Each family shares in the planning and operation of the school. Parents staff the school under the direct guidance of our director, Eva Barahona, who is a qualified, Master's-level preschool teacher with 20+ years of experience as a preschool director. Annie Bertram, who achieved her master's degree in Early Childhood Education, also teaches at the school, as well as heading up our afternoon program and summer camp. We maintain a 4:1 student-teacher ratio.

This school, like all co-operative preschools, is where your child can take those first steps into the world while still holding your hand. You come to school, too. You will be amazed and delighted at the benefits which you, the parent, will receive; you will truly become a better parent and will grow and learn alongside your child.

The school is a proud and active member of the <a href="http://www.ccppns.org" target="_blank">California Council of Parent Participation Nursery Schools</a>, serving families of Noe and Eureka Valley, Bernal Heights, Potrero Hill, Mission and other San Francisco neighborhoods since 1969.

This is a place where you can be your best and it will be both appreciated and recognized. It is a place in which children extend the love they have for their parents to other children's parents, and where parents extend the love they have for their children to other people's children. It is a rich and healthy environment for everyone involved - the parents, the children, and the teachers.

At Noe Valley Nursery School we are all ethnicities, religions, orientations, abilities, and backgrounds. No matter where we come from, we are one inclusive community. We celebrate our differences.

We all learn here, and then we pass it on.
