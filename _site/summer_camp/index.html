        <h2>Summer Camp 2017</h2>

        <p>Noe Valley Nursery School is offering seven weeks of Summer Camp fun this year. Each week a maximum of 10 kids from 3-5 years old will spend wonderful days with Teacher Johnana, plus an Assistant Teacher. The camp day will run from 9AM to 1PM. Parents are asked to pack a lunch for their child, while snack will be provided by the school.</p>

        <h2>Camp Director: Johana Barahona</h2>

        <p>Johana Barahona obtained her bachelors degree in behavioral sciences at UC Santa Cruz in 2008, and completed her ECE requirements to become preschool teacher/director qualified at Merritt College. Johana enjoys observing children build self esteem, negotiate, grow, and socialize through play, which is a vital learning tool. She is excited for all that's to come this summer!</p>

        In addition, [Teacher Andrew](/arts) will do his music class with the kids once a week!

        <h2>Rates</h2>

        <p>$5 off each week when you sign up for more than one week at a time. In other words, if you sign up for 3 weeks, your rate goes from $275 per week to $265 per week.</p>

        <h2>Themes</h2>

        <h3>Week 1 (June 5th-9th) Math Madness:</h3>

        We will discover new games and challenges by using special materials such as toys, songs, and puzzles to take a closer look at the world of math. While doing so, we will uncover numbers, patterns, geometry, and measurement. We will also learn more about counting, categorizing, and shapes.

        <h3>Week 2 (June 12-16) Words with Friends:</h3>

        This unique opportunity will allow children to develop literacy through books, stories, and acting. We will be using props such as puppets and costumes as well. The focus of this week is fun with comprehension. Together we will read, tell, and discuss stories. Children will also get the chance to create new stories of their own!

        <h3>Week 3 (June 19-23) Nature and the World Around Us:</h3>
        Join us on an adventure as we take a closer look at nature and science in our very own backyard, inspired by Glen Canyon and the garden around Noe Valley Nursery School. Learning through play and careful observation, campers will explore their connection to nature and to each other. The children will learn to foster a deeper appreciation and respect for nature and develop their sense of stewardship. You can expect your child to come home tired, dirty, and with lots of adventures to tell you about!

        <h3>Week 4 (June 26- June 30) Exploring Art:</h3>

        Together we will nurture creativity through art by exploring color, line, form, design, space, and texture. We will also examine the works of famous artists who have had a major influence on art as we know it. Children will have the opportunity to express themselves through art by drawing, painting, stamping, sculpturing, and collaging. As a group we will create individual pieces, as well as one giant masterpiece together. Throughout the week, we will incorporate our whole bodies with music and dance.

        _Note that there is no camp on the week of the 4th of July, from July 3rd to July 7th._

        <h3>Week 5 (July 10-14) Math Madness:</h3>
