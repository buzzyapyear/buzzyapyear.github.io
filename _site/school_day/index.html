    <h2>General schedule</h2>

<p>A normal school day is from 9:00 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., Monday through Friday. Working parents arrive at 8:30 a.m. to prepare the activities of the day.</p>

<p>9 - 10 am We start with a full hour of outdoor play at <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/christopher-playground-san-francisco" target="_blank">Christopher Playground</a>.</p>

<p>10 am We wash hands and have snack provided by a member family.</p>

<p>10:30-11:30 am We have another full hour play in the school and the school's outdoor patio where children may play freely or join any activity which is of interest to them. A teacher regularly takes the children on a nature walk down to <a href="http://sfrecpark.org/destination/glen-park/" target="_blank">Glen Canyon</a> or to the <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-little-red-hen-community-garden-san-francisco" target="_blank">Community Garden</a> to visit our gardening plot where we plant and harvest local fruits and vegetables.</p>

<p>11:30-12 pm We come together for circle time for stories and music led by our teachers or one of the parents.</p>

<p>12 pm We come together again for lunch, which is brought from home.</p>

<p>Every Thursday, children have the option of going to the pool at the Janet Pomeroy Center to swim. The pool is warm, shallow and great for beginners, and there is a trained lifeguard on duty. Working parents drive the children to and from the pool.</p>

<p>On Fridays, music educator Andrew Gomez joins us for circle time. <a href="/arts">See more info about this on our arts page</a>.</p>

<h2>Afternoon Program</h2>

<p>Our afternoon program is a relatively new opportunity for parents and students at Noe Valley Nursery School. It is available for children who are enrolled in the morning program at NVNS, and it extends the school day until 3:30 PM.</p>

<p>The program is led by Annie Bertram, who achieved her master's degree in Early Childhood Education at George Fox University. She also works with the morning class, and is dedicated to helping every student achieve his or her developmental goals.</p>

<p>The afternoon program provides a supportive and creative learning environment that encompasses our school's play-based philosophy while enhancing kindergarten readiness. With a smaller class size in the afternoon, the children are better able to focus and cooperate as a group when playing or working on projects.</p>

<p>The afternoon program is offered as an extension to NVNS students. We are currently accepting applications for the 2016-2017 school year, and hope that you will join us!</p>
