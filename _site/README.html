## Troubleshooting

### Gulp

#### Changes to CSS and JS don't seem to be reflected in my dev environment

If you attempted to save invalid JS or CSS, it's possible that the minification processes caused Gulp to exit with an exception.  

First of all, this means that your saves going forward won't be processed until you restart Gulp, and you might not realize it for a while.

Secondly, sometimes Ruby fails to release the machine's process when exiting, meaning that when you start Gulp back up, it can behave erratically if it can't serve itself off of the address and port (default would be localhost:4000) it expects to.  When this happens you'll probably see some warning in the console output when restarting Gulp that looks like this:

`[19:14:46] Jekyll: jekyll 3.4.0 | Error:  Address already in use - bind(2)`

When this happens, you can look up the process ID and force it to stop using `kill`.

First, find the process ID with:

`lsof -wni tcp:4000`

Then, kill the process.  For example, if the PID you found from the previous command was `12345`:

`kill -9 12345`
