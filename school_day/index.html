        <h3>Swimming</h3>
        <p>Every Thursday, children have the option of going to the pool at the Janet Pomeroy Center to swim. The pool is warm, shallow and great for beginners, and there is a trained lifeguard on duty. Working parents drive the children to and from the pool.</p>

        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>On Fridays, music educator Andrew Gomez joins us for circle time. <a href="/arts">See more info about this on our arts page</a>.</p>

        <h2>Afternoon Program</h2>

        <p>Our afternoon program is a relatively new opportunity for parents and students at Noe Valley Nursery School. It is available for children who are enrolled in the morning program at NVNS, and it extends the school day until 3:30 PM.</p>

        <p>The program is led by Annie Bertram, who achieved her master's degree in Early Childhood Education at George Fox University. She also works with the morning class, and is dedicated to helping every student achieve his or her developmental goals.</p>

        <p>The afternoon program provides a supportive and creative learning environment that encompasses our school's play-based philosophy while enhancing kindergarten readiness. With a smaller class size in the afternoon, the children are better able to focus and cooperate as a group when playing or working on projects.</p>

        <p>The afternoon program is offered as an extension to NVNS students. We hope that you will join us!</p>
