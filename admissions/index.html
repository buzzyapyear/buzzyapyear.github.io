        <h2>How to Enroll</h2>

        <p>First, attend a Parent Information Night where parents and the director will provide information about parent responsibilities, cost, and the developmentally appropriate curriculum.</p>

        <p>Then, if you would like, you can schedule a visit to the school with your child where you will have an opportunity to observe your child in the school environment. You can either fill in the application form with a $40 non-refundable fee at the Information night or take the form with you and mail it in.</p>

        <p>Our membership coordinator will contact you when a spot is available. If there is no current opening, then your child will be placed into the waiting pool.</p>

        <p>Our next parent information nights will take place October 3rd and January 23rd at 7pm - 8:30pm. If you are interested in enrolling for the 2016-17 school year in the meantime, please contact <a href="mailto:membership@noevalleynurseryschool.com">membership@noevalleynurseryschool.com</a>.</p>
